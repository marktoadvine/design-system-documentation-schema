/**
 * Generates site/content/style-guide.mdx from STYLE_GUIDE.md, so the guide is published on the
 * site without becoming a second copy of itself. STYLE_GUIDE.md stays the file people edit -
 * it's what README, the lint messages, and the rule catalog all cite - and this rewrites it
 * into the form the site build expects.
 *
 * Three things have to change on the way across:
 *   1. Frontmatter, which the root file has none of and every page needs.
 *   2. Links to schema files. `schema/entries/entry.schema.yaml` is a real path on GitHub but
 *      nothing the site serves; the site serves the same file at /v<version>/entries/... So
 *      those are rewritten to the versioned artifact path, which is also the form
 *      check-internal-links.mjs deliberately skips (a versioned artifact, not a page).
 *   3. Absolute designsystemdocspec.org links, which are right on GitHub and wrong on the site
 *      itself - a page shouldn't send a reader out to the network to reach its own sibling.
 *
 * Run with --check to assert the committed .mdx matches what STYLE_GUIDE.md would produce.
 * Wired into `npm run generate` and `npm run generate:check`.
