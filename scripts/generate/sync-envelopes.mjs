/**
 * Writes AGENTS.md's two field-list blocks from the schema files that own them.
 *
 * AGENTS.md is the first file an agent reads, and it teaches two lists: the fields every entry
 * shares (entries/entry.schema.yaml) and the fields every section shares
 * (sections/section.schema.yaml). Both were typed by hand. The entry one had drifted - `id`
 * before `kind`, and `sections` moved to the end - while the paragraph beside it said the
 * tooling reads the order out of the schema so it can't be wrong. It couldn't be wrong; the
 * list next to it could, and was.
 *
 * These are the same lists `declaredProps` hands to DSDS-17, DSDS-20 and DSDS-22, and the same
 * ones the Schema page's property tables are built from. Now they're also the ones AGENTS.md
 * prints, so an agent that learns the envelope here writes the order the linter checks.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/generate/sync-envelopes.mjs           # rewrite the blocks
 *   node scripts/generate/sync-envelopes.mjs --check   # exit 1 if either has drifted
