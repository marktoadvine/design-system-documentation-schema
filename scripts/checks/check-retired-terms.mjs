/**
 * Fails when a retired term reappears in prose. schema/terms.yaml records which word wins for
 * each concept; this is what stops the losing one drifting back in.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. terms.yaml's `not` column lists every synonym a reviewer should push
 * back on, but most of them are ordinary English somewhere else — "tool" is right when it means
 * an actual tool, "item" is a real field name, "type" appears in every `type: string`. Grepping
 * the whole column would produce noise nobody reads. So this checks only terms that named a
 * thing the current model no longer has, where any occurrence in prose is a real mistake:
 *
 *   entity / entities   the pre-0.20.0 word for an entry
 *   documentBlock       the pre-0.20.0 word for a section
 *   spec file           a document; "spec" is the specification
 *
 * CHANGELOG and the migration guide are exempt: describing the old model is their job.
 *
 * Run via `npm run check:docs`.
