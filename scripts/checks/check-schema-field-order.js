// STYLE_GUIDE.md tells authors to write a document's fields in the order the schema files
// list them, which makes those files the only record of that order. This asserts the schema
// files don't contradict each other about it.
//
// A kind file narrows some of the fields its base already declares - entries/token.schema.yaml
// redeclares `id` to loosen the pattern, every kind file redeclares `kind` to pin a const. When
// a kind file lists those shared fields in a different order than the base does, the two files
// disagree about the order authors are being told to follow. That happened: token.schema.yaml
// listed `kind, metadata, id` while entry.schema.yaml listed `id` first.
//
// Only the shared fields are checked, and only their order relative to each other. A kind file
// is free to put its own novel fields wherever it likes, and they do vary - definitions puts
// its novel field after `items` while guidelines and steps put theirs before. Nothing depends
// on that placement, because lib.js's entryFieldOrder drops the redeclared fields and reads the
// novel ones as a group.
